If we are supporting your [digital participation project](/projects/) or you have signed our [digital participation charter](/charter/) then you will have a page on this website where you can share a bit more about who you are and what you are doing. This is a short, step-by-step guide to adding content and editing your page along with some quick walkthrough videos to give you some extra guidance if needed.

## Before you start

Our website is powered by a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so if you do not already have a GitHub account then you will need to create one:

* [Click here to create a new GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

Creating an account is free and you only need to do this step once.  The video below will guide you through the sign up process.

## Updating a page

Follow these steps to send us an update:

1. Find the page you want to edit
2. Click the "Update this page" button (it'll be near the bottom of the page)
3. Make your changes in the box marked "Edit file"
4. Click the "Propose file change" button
5. On the next screen describe the changes you've made, and then click the "Send pull request" button

The last step will notify us that there are changes pending, and from here it's our job to review and then publish your updated page.  To see a quick walkthrough of this process, just watch the video below.

## Tips for editing your page

When you're in GitHub, the editable version of your page looks a lot like a plain text file.

### Front matter

The top part of the file, sandwiched between two sets of `---` marks, is known as the **front matter** (or *metadata*). We use the information here to help build the page and give it the correct address on the internet. **You should avoid editing this section unless you are sure you know what you are doing!**

### Content

Immediately after the front matter is the **content** of the page itself.

Here are some useful tips for editing the content:

* You don't need to worry about fonts or colours, these will get set automatically
* Remember to leave a blank line between paragraphs
* You can use [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) for things like headings and links
* You can also use regular HTML if you wish

### Embedding media

Our pages accept HTML, which means you can embed photos, videos and social media from other websites. The details will be different depending on which services you decide to use, but you'll usually be looking for an option called "embed" which will give you some code to copy and paste into your page.  The short video below will give you a brief overview of how to embed different types of media on your page.
