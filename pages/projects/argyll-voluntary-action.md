## Project plan

### Project description

We will provide informal monthly drop-in Digital clubs at the 6 main settlements of Argyll & Bute. The clubs will support and advise people to use eg email accounts, social media, skype, webchat, web browsing safely. An online resource will replicate this to reach remote areas. We expect to provide learning opportunities as a gateway to developing skills, reduce isolation and help build social capital. People will have a support network and become more confident as a result.
