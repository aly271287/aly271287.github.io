## Project plan

### Project description

Growing our community resources via a website and the digitalisation of our historical archives; In doing so, we will develop digital skills and promote our community locally and to a broad global network. We will:- - Use digitisation as a method for actively engaging community members in developing digital skills through the production of a heritage website and digital archives. - Develop the necessary skill base within the community to maintain and sustain a lasting digital resource. - Use skill exchange and training between community members to engage the community with the archive and share skills. - Use the process as a learning experience which promotes the participation of members and the wider community. - Increase our audiences steadily and set ambitious targets for future growth. - Increase audience engagement with the resources and programmes online
