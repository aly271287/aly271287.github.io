## Project plan

### Project description

Moray Firth Media Trust will be working with prisoners at Inverness Prison. We are running six part time courses in digital audio and radio broadcasting production. In addition to improving confidence, motivation and core vocational skills, participants will learn basic digital skills and with the use of digital equipment such as portable recorders, Adobe Audition and other software, will learn how to digitally edit the sounds and to build their own show to a specific time frame. A certificate will be gained on completion of the course.
