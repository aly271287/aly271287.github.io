## Project plan

### Project description

Building on our role as a community hub we will offer drop-in training sessions. We will research the specific needs in the area using our shop as a place to meet people and raise the profile of the service as well as advertising through other community groups. A questionnaire will facilitate the process. We will offer drop-in sessions in the Centre led by a familiar face from Ravenspoint. Our aim is that 30 people will benefit from the sessions which will be short, focused and flexible and, depending on demand will be 1 + 1 or in small groups.
