## Project plan

### Project description

It is proposed to extend the existing services provided by the project to meet the needs of service users by offering basic computer skills, job search support and literacy and numeracy support. This will be provided by volunteers initially. Working with other providers the facility will be offered out with project times more generally to support online job search. Our aim is to help our clients to gain skills and confidence to move on to more mainstream learning and so widen their social circles away from the chaotic lifestyles they lead
•	Participants will gain basic ICT skills
•	Participants will gain confidence in using computers for job search
•	Participants will be able to search the internet and send emails
•	Participants will improve reading writing, spelling and number skills
•	Participants will gain confidence to move on to other learning environments, thus widening their social  circles away from the lifestyles they are leading
Learning will take place on a one to one or small group basis depending on individual needs. A Job Club will also be run to support people undertaking job search on line, write CVs and apply for jobs. The Project will operate initially within the Drop – in hours, with participants wishing to use the Job Club coming in before Drop – in. It is anticipated that these hours will change as the Learning Zone becomes established
