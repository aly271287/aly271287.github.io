## Project plan

### Project description

To recruit a part time Volunteer Coordinator to oversee the delivery of a Volunteer Digital Champions programme for the Smart Communities Project. This will allow us to develop a new strand which will encourage the sharing of knowledge and provide valuable experience and relevant qualifications for volunteers, enhancing their opportunities for employment and increasing our capacity to positively affect change for people living in our communities. The outcomes of the project are to recruit 30 Volunteer Digital Champions across the 5 communities with the aim of each volunteer assisting 2 local people to help them develop their digital skills and access. This will be achieved with the support of the Volunteer Coordinator who will ensure the recruitment, opportunity, support and accreditation for each volunteer in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College.
