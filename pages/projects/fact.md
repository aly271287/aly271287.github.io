## Project plan

### Project description

FACT, in partnership with others, will develop a programme of training for online learning and activity in Forres. We will recruit, train and support volunteer tutors to provide sessions for individuals to develop and use digital skills by learning about, safe and easy use of digital technology. FACT will provide a fully equipped training room with free Wifi access various laptops and tablets and will run a programme of events, drop-in clinics and one to one help. 
More Forres older people will connect with friends and family, access online shopping and banking which will reduce isolation, access new services and stimulate interest in topics of individual interest.
Forres volunteers will develop tutoring skills to enhance their existing digital skills, and will increase their contribution to the community.
Forres job seekers and benefit claimants will become better informed by improved access to online information.
