## Project plan

### Project description

Introduction to the various types of computers available with the accent on tablets and notebooks to allow the participants to make an informed choice matched to their requirements. Instruction in the use of these computers and the software available.

Initially present members, who are mainly elderly, and either do not have a computer or have an outdated one will be given the chance to try out the various types to guide them in their choice of computer type. This will be followed by instruction in the use of the chosen type. At the end of this period, assessment will be carried out and, on the basis of this, any required changes will be made before recruitment of new members.
