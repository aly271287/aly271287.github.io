## Project plan

### Project description

In light of the growing potential of iPads (and other mobile technologies) to meet the diverse needs of people with aphasia and the need to support them in their use of such technologies, we want to establish a pilot support group where adults with aphasia can explore the benefits of technology and gain the skills required to access these tools within a structured environment. The overall goal is to develop and evaluate a framework for establishing a technology support group for people with aphasia which can be rolled out in other settings.
