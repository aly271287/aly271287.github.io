excerpt: We think the internet should be for everyone, so we're leading an ambitious programme to promote digital participation and basic digital skills.

It’s easy to take the internet for granted, but more than a million people in Scotland lack the [basic digital skills](/basic-digital-skills/) to communicate, find information, get things done and stay safe on the web. What's more, many charities and voluntary organisations are missing a huge opportunity to boost their impact and engagement by using digital tools.

We’re part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk), and are working with partners across the country to promote digital participation. Our work is generously supported by core funding from the [Scottish Government](http://www.gov.scot), and closely linked to the wider [Digital Scotland](http://www.digitalscotland.org/) agenda.



## Our blog

We love to blog about what we're up to! You'll find our posts on the main SCVO website, alongside posts from our colleagues in other parts of the organisation.

We're happy to publish posts written by other people too, so if you'd like to talk about writing a guest blog for us then [get in touch](/contact/).
