Milo is the database and interaction management system for the <a href="http://www.vascotland.org/tsis" target="_blank">**Third Sector Interface**</a> (TSI) network in Scotland. Milo is funded by the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/" target="_blank">**Scottish Government**</a>, managed by <a href="http://www.scvo.org.uk/" target="_blank">**SCVO**</a>, and was designed and implemented by <a href="http://www.soprasteria.co.uk/" target="_blank">**Sopra Group**</a>. TSIs have been using the system to manage their interactions with voluntary organisations and volunteers since 2012.

Milo is currently undergoing a full system rebuild on the Salesforce platform. TSIs are expected to migrate to the new system in **May/June of 2015**, before support for the existing system ceases on **30th June 2015**.

This FAQ is the online resource for your questions about Milo. If you don’t find what you’re looking for here, drop us an [email](mailto:gavin.bell@scvo.org.uk) and we’ll make sure we address your query. 

### Why is Milo moving to a new system?

The current Milo system is supported by Sopra Group and hosted at <a href="http://www.pulsant.com/" target="_blank">**Pulsant**</a>, however ongoing support costs are unsustainable in the light of cuts to Scottish Government funding. In addition to this, the bespoke build of the system means development and bug fixes are prohibitively expensive. Therefore a full system rebuild will be undertaken by Synovations to implement Milo on the Salesforce platform.

### Who is designing the new system?

<a href="http://synovations.co.uk/" target="_blank">**Synovations**</a> is a technical company specialising in solutions for nonprofits and the charity sector. They have a strong record of delivering on solutions for nonprofits, including SCVO and <a href="http://www.evoc.org.uk/" target="_blank">**EVOC**</a> (part of the Edinburgh TSI). Following a tender process in the summer of 2014, Synovations was selected as the new technology partner for Milo, with a proposal to rebuild the system on the Salesforce platform.

### What is Salesforce?

<a href="http://www.salesforce.com/uk/" target="_blank">**Salesforce**</a> is one of the world’s most-used CRM (customer relationship management) platforms. It is a cloud-based solution providing excellent features and usability out of the box for recording and analysing data, but is also extremely customisable to meet the needs of Milo users. 

### What will be different about the new system?

The major changes will be positive. The new version of Milo will be more user-friendly, more easily navigable, and more customisable for different users and TSIs. Changes and improvements will be possible more quickly and on a far more cost-effective basis.

#### Existing data

The bulk of existing data will be migrated to the new system, so TSIs will be able to view, edit and manage their existing organisations, contacts, volunteer registrations and volunteer opportunities. The one area of the database that will change is Episodes & Interactions (see below).

#### Main database entities

The system will still operate according to the same principles, allowing users to view, edit, and create new **organisations**, **contacts**, **volunteers** and **opportunities**. TSIs will also be able to record interactions, although this will be done in a slightly different way from the existing system.

#### What is happening to Episodes and Interactions?

In a nutshell, the top level of the old structure (episodes) is being removed, and TSIs will now record interactions directly. This is similar to the ‘case file’ approach to the current structure already used by some TSIs. In most cases, this means new interactions will start on the date you first use the system.

#### Will all of my old Episodes and Interactions vanish?

Because of the new structure, it may not be possible to import your historic interactions exactly as they are on the old system. Historic interactions will be copied from the existing database and will be available to view for your TSI.

#### Can I still run reports on the data?

Yes – users will be able to design and run reports using a drag-and-drop interface. Different views and dashboards can also be customised to display frequently-required reports. All reports are exportable as Excel or CVS files.

#### Will we still need a special reporting licence like on the existing system?

No, you will no longer need to access a separate report server, and will not require a named reports user.

#### Can we export reports to Word, PDF etc.?

Exporting reports in from Salesforce to Word etc. is possible, but currently requires a separate app called <a href="http://www.congamerge.com/products/composer" target="_blank">**Conga Composer**</a>. We are currently investigating TSI requirements for exporting data to identify the best solution. As noted above, all reports can be exported to Excel.

### Document storage / discussion forums

Document storage and communication between Milo users will work differently on the new system, reflecting both the way users interact with Milo, and technological advances over the last few years.

#### Will we still be able to attach documents to interactions and volunteer registrations? 

Yes, and in an improvement to current functionality, you will be able to attach notes and documents to organisation, opportunity and contact records as well. 

#### Is there a storage limit on uploading documents?

Memory is included with the licences. There is a data limit on uploads, but this should not get in the way of uploading standard documents. As long as you don’t attach videos to every record, you should be fine!

#### Will there still be a document library like on the current system?

The new system will not have a separate document library as there was on the old system. Documents relating to organisations, contacts and interactions can be attached to the relevant entity. General documents that need to be made accessible to all users (e.g. training documentation) will be uploaded to **Chatter** (see below).

#### Will there be discussion forums?

Discussion and communication between users on Milo will now be managed using <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/uk/chatter/overview/" target="_blank">**Chatter**</a>, a more modern social networking solution which will enable users to post public and private communications about all things Milo, from troubleshooting to new innovations. 

### When will TSIs migrate to the new system?

The system rebuild has been underway since December. We are currently on track to have the new system available by the **end of May 2015**. 

#### Will there be any downtime during migration?

Yes. To ensure everything works properly when TSIs access the new system, there will be one week’s downtime between the cutoff for data input to the old system and access to the new system. This will be a one-time period of downtime, and will ensure the migration runs as smoothly as possible with a minimum of disruption.

### Will there be training for the new system?

Yes. Training documentation and online tutorials will be available before the launch of the new system. Milo leads at TSIs will be able to test the system ahead of migration to provide feedback on usability.

#### Will there be on-site training?

Due to increased pressures on budgets, SCVO are unable to provide on-site training on the new system. Training will be provided through a combination of documentation, online tutorials, and support from the Milo technical team.

#### How much training will be required for existing users?

Because the new system will work on the same principles as the old one, existing users should be able to find their way around the new system fairly easily. The training support will be developed to work for both users of the existing system and completely new users.

#### Is there any general Salesforce online training available?

Salesforce has a vast bank of support resources online to help build users’ knowledge of the platform and complement use of Milo. The opportunities for tailoring the user experience locally are far greater than with the current bespoke system.

### System support

As per Scottish Government funding requirements, SCVO will continue to provide free technical support to TSI users accessing the Milo system. Access to Milo will continue to be free for TSIs subject to licence restrictions.

#### How does licencing work?

All Milo users will require a Salesforce licence to access the system. Each TSI will be allocated a number of free licences. If a TSI requires more licences than their standard allocation, they will be able to purchase them through SCVO at the charity discount rate. As of March 2015, basic Salesforce licences for nonprofits are currently priced at £36 p.a. exclusive of VAT.

#### What if licence-holders leave the TSI?

Licences can be transferred to a new named user at no cost.

### Websites

The new system will provide easier integration with websites, including existing feeds like <a href="http://www.volunteerscotland.net" target="_blank">**Volunteer Scotland**</a> and <a href="http://www.getinvolved.org.uk" target="_blank">**Get Involved**</a>.

#### Will opportunities still feed through to Volunteer Scotland?

Yes. Synovations is working with Volunteer Scotland to ensure that opportunities will feed the VS website when TSIs go live on the system

#### What about iFrames?

TSIs will be able to host their own local iFrames to display organisations and local opportunities as before. These will be available following migration as we want to make sure they’re more customisable and attractive than the current models.

#### Will the feed to websites remain one-way?

The good news is that Salesforce allows the potential for creating web forms that can import data straight into the database. So, for example, you could have a members update form that was able to populate records on the database. This is an important area for future development.
