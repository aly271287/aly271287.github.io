title: Scotland's Digital Participation Charter
excerpt: We're inviting organisations across Scotland to join a national movement to promote digital participation and basic digital skills.
permalink: /charter/
---

Our shared ambition is for Scotland to be a world-leading digital nation by 2020. Central to achieving this, and maximising the benefits from Scotland's investment in digital infrastructure, is ensuring that everyone has the access, motivation and [basic digital skills](/basic-digital-skills/) required to participate fully in our digital world.

Efforts to scale up and accelerate activity in Scotland are coordinated through a [Digital Participation Programme](/) led by the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk), with a [Leadership Group](/about/#leadership-group) drawn from the public, private and third sectors.

This charter establishes a framework for organisations in Scotland to support the Digital Participation Programme and to pursue our shared ambition. Signatories to the Charter commit to working together in a spirit of partnership to promote digital participation in Scotland.
