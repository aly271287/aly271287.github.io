## Section 2

**2.3** – Tell us a little bit about your organisation and, more specifically, the area of the organisation that the project relates to. Is it a social enterprise arm, is it a new initiative?

Here we would like you to provide a concise description of your business growth project – what you aim to deliver, an evidenced understanding that it can be achieved within the 6 weeks and the expected business growth benefit.

This is all about giving us the big picture so we can see where the project fits with your organisation.

**2.4** – The outputs that your project will deliver for your organisation should reflect the changes that are being made as a result of it. Depending on the focus of your project, the outputs could include a new website that is mobile responsive, the introduction of a cloud computing system such as Office365 or your staff trained in the new technology. Remember that there could be multiple outputs from one project.

**2.5** – The specific outcomes of the project should focus on what impact /change the outputs will have on your organisation. You should think about these in a short, medium and long term context.

For example, a project to deliver a cloud storage solution might seek to achieve the following outcomes:

1. Short term: employees trained in how to use the software, files and documents migrated to the new system and employees no longer restricted to office working.
2. Medium term: workforce can operate more efficiently and associated savings can be directed back into service delivery.
3. Long term: dynamic approach to working will allow operations to expand into new geographic areas and new services can be delivered in a mobile format.

**2.6** – Try to give us some extra details about how the project will support your organisation’s growth – does it form part of a wider strategy and if so, how?

**2.7** – We are looking for two parts to this response. Firstly, tell us how you will monitor the progress on the actual project over the 6 week period. This might include the creation of a work plan (draft copies are welcomed!) and formal weekly meetings to check on progress. Remember that, as this is a 6 week internship, if you normally hold monthly catch ups/review meetings you may need to adapt your approach.

Secondly, we would like to know how you will monitor the progress of the project over the longer term. Make sure that whatever you propose is appropriate to the project. For example, a project that sees you launch a Twitter account may monitor the number of followers you have each month, check that you are publishing new and appropriate content or track the number of employees trained.

**2.8** – In this response, similar to 2.7, please ensure whatever measurement you are proposing is appropriate to the project and the area of growth. For example, you could use Google analytics to monitor the number of people visiting your new website, an employee survey could give you an understanding of how successful a new system is or you could use monitor the amount of money raised through your new online platform.

**2.9** – Don’t be afraid to tell us what you need here! We hope that your relationship with your mentor will last much longer than the six weeks so we want to make sure you’re right for each other. Do you need help in the interview process? Do you need a company that knows all about online booking systems? Or something completely different?

For any applicants who anticipate potential barriers to recruiting an intern locally (lack of premises or remote/rural location etc) there is scope for the interns to be hosted at the premises of the business mentor. If you think this may help your project come to fruition please make it known.



## Section 3

**3.3** – This answer will form the basis of the job advert that goes out via JobCentre Plus so think carefully about what to include here. In addition to the core aspects of the internship role (developing the new website, for example) there may be associated tasks, such as training staff on how to keep it up-to-date or reporting on progress at weekly meetings that should be included as well.

Avoid including generic statements such as “help around the office” – remember you’re recruiting a graduate to deliver a project, not just an additional person to help out.

**3.4/5** – Have a think about what skills are essential to successfully undertaking the role and what are only desirable. We understand that you may not have a full picture of the technical side of the role at this stage so we’re more than happy to help work it up. The better the description here the more likely it is you will find a graduate with the skills you’re after.

**3.6** - The intern is going to be working with you as a full member of the team for the duration of their placement so they will experience a real range of different activities and processes. Have a think about the different aspects that they will be involved in or manage, some examples may be – project management, presentation skills, experiencing the third sector, visit some front line services, report writing, time management etc.



## Section 4

**4.1** – We want to ensure that the intern is going to get the support, supervision and mentoring that they need to be successful in their project. In your response please make sure that you explain who they will be reporting to, how their progress will be monitored and how of often this will happen. Explain how they will be inducted to your organisation, and if you will provide any on the job training.

**4.2** – Whilst we appreciate that it’s not always possible to offer additional training opportunities, if there are other ways you can support through signposting etc. or offering internal training courses then that’s great. Of course, if you are in a position to offer a training budget then that’s a real bonus! On the job mentoring, such as helping someone develop their portfolio or giving guidance on their CV or career path, could be just as valuable.
